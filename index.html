        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love writing because it makes you in charge of a world. I'm not normally in charge in the real world, but when I'm writing I can decide what I want everyone to do. It's also a really good way to just get lost and lose track of everything. When I need a break from life, I like to write and shape things how I'd like them to be. </p>

        <p>This is the notebook I usually use to write, it's mostly filled with notes and ideas. But towards the end, I have more structured stories. I also have a lot of notes on my phone, because it's easily accessible. </p>
